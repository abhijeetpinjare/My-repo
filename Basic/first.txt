 Ten pundits (holy men) went to the Ganga to take a dip in the river.  
They held each other’s hands as they took dips thrice. When they came up the third 
time, they were not holding hands. 
“Let’s make sure all of us have come out of the river safely,” said a pundit, 
“Everybody stand in line. I will count.” 
 The other holy men liked the idea and lined up as the pundit took count, “1, 2, 3, 
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9…” He stopped at 9 as the line came to an end. 
“Nine, only nine,” screamed one of the pundits. 
“Oh no, one of us has drowned in the river,” cried out another. 
 “You move aside. Let me take the count.  
Everybody, stand in a line,” said the second pundit. 
He began counting. He too could count only 9 people.  
All the pundits started crying for their lost friend.
